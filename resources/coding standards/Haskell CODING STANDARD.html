<p>Failure to follow the coding standards as outlined may result in 
grade penalties on the assignment(s) in which coding standards were 
violated, up to and not exceeding 25% of the total maximum grade of that
 assignment.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this standard may be made on a per-assignment or 
per-question basis as necessary to encourage your learning, all 
exceptions will be explicitly stated. Failure to follow directive and/or
 instructions in regard to any part of an assignment (e.g. using 
functions or code patterns explicitly restricted, or failing to use 
functions or patterns explicitly required) is not a coding standards 
violation and deductions for failure to follow instructions are not 
limited to 25% of the total maximum grade for that assignment.</p>

<h3>Filetype:</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, Haskell homeworks must be turned in as 
valid Haskell files. All Haskell files must have the .hs filetype, 
occasionally you may be required to submit code in Literate Haskell 
(.lhs).</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, assignments must be turned in as a single file covering all required statements and definitions.</p>

<h3>Naming:</h3>
<p>Function names may be in camelCase or road_kill_case/snake_case, as 
long as the function names are adequately descriptive and one case 
formatting is used throughout the code.</p>
<p>Exception: mandatory function names (i.e. you are required to write 
the function "foo_bar") must be used as given even when they differ from
 the case style used throughout your code, your choice of case is 
allowed to differ from that of mandatory symbols.</p>

<h3>Indentation:</h3>
<p>All multi-line code must be logically indented and should aid the 
readability of the code, no determinations will be made on whether a 
line should be broken into multiple lines unless you are writing only 
single-line code to avoid properly indenting your code.</p>
<p>Indentation may be achieved by either tabs or spaces, do not mix the 
two for indentation purposes unless you decide to alternate in-line or 
by-line, regardless: consistency is required unless you are using emacs.</p>

<h3>Commenting/Non-executable code:</h3>
<p>Comments may be either single line via double dash (--) or multi-line
 via start ({-) and end (-}) tags. Comments interrupting a line of code 
should be avoided unless necessary for code clarification. Large blocks 
of commented-out or otherwise unused code should not be submitted as 
part of an assignment: if you are unable to complete some portion of 
assignment but would like to submit what you have for partial credit you
 must ensure that what you have is functional helper methods with 
comments indicating their intended use.</p>
<p>One or more comments at the top of each file turned in must contain your name (Last, First) and UNM Net ID.</p>

<h3>Haskell Specific Items</h3>
<p>Code submitted will use explicit type signatures, these aid in reading as well as writing code.</p>
<p>Helper methods used in only one function must be defined using "let 
... in ..." syntax, or "where" sytax, and not written at top level.</p>

<h3>Updates:</h3>
<p>Updates to this file will be made as necessary on a per-assignment 
basis, it is your responsibility to ensure you follow coding standards 
and to check that you are in adherence prior to submitting an 
assignment. Resubmissions more than 24 hours after the due date of an 
assignment to bring a submitted and ungraded file into compliance may be
 penalized in accordance with the existing late penalty, resubmissions 
of already-graded assignments may only be accepted and regraded under 
demonstrated extenuating circumstances.</p>

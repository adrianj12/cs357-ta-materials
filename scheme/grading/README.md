***Grader usage:***
In a directory with the following structure:
```
grading-dir
|- grader
|- testcases.rkt
|- submissions
|  |- student1.rkt
|  |- student2.rkt
|  ...
|- feedback
   <initially empty>
```
execute the command `./grader "testcases.rkt"` and all submission files in the `submissions` directory will be graded and feedback files will be created in the `feedback` directory. See the folder `sample-assignment` for an example.
